## Ravit Dabush – My Personal Website & Creative Dev Space 🌸

Welcome to the repo that powers my personal site — a space that blends design, development, and identity into one evolving creation.

This isn’t just a portfolio site.  
It’s a live, expressive system that represents who I am:  
a front-end developer, a creative thinker, and a designer of both code and experience.

It's structured. It's scalable. And yes, it sparkles a little ✨

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm Ravit Dabush — a passionate Front-End Developer with a love for clean code, deep user experience, and refined design principles.  
I don’t just write code — I **live it**.

This project is personal. Every component reflects my standards and values — from precise typography to carefully curated icons.  
It captures emotion, precision, and intention.

## 📁 Overview

A bilingual, handcrafted portfolio site showcasing my journey as a frontend developer. 
Built with precision using Next.js, TypeScript, and SCSS, it reflects my design sensibility, technical depth, and attention to user experience.

This site is more than just a portfolio – it's a fully documented, component-based system reflecting how I build, document, and think as a developer.
It includes:
- A custom design system
- A living style guide
- Dynamic routing and i18n with `next-intl`
- Accessibility considerations
- Structured project architecture
- Developer-first workflows (Git + Jira integration)
