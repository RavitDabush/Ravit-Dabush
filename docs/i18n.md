# 🌍 Internationalization (i18n) Setup

This document describes how multilingual support is implemented using `next-intl`.

---

## 🗂 Translation Strategy

Translations are organized by component.  
Each locale has its own folder (e.g., `en/`, `he/`) containing separate JSON files per component.  
This encourages modularity, clarity, and easy scaling.

All translation files use a **flat key structure** — keys are not namespaced or nested.  
Each JSON file contains only the keys relevant to its component.

---

## 📦 Library
- [`next-intl`](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/) is used for translations and language-based routing
- Installed via `npm install next-intl`

---

## 📁 Structure

```
messages/
├─ en/[component-name].json
├─ he/[component-name].json
```

---

## 🧩 Integration
- `next-intl` provider is wrapped at `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`
- `useTranslations()` hook used in components

Example usage:
```tsx
const t = useTranslations('home')
return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>
```

---

## 🌐 Routing
- Locale folders under `app/`: `app/en/`, `app/he/`
- URLs follow the pattern: `/en/...` and `/he/...`
- Default locale is set in middleware config

---

## 🧪 Development Aids
- `i18n Ally` VSCode extension allows browsing and inline editing of translation files
- Language switcher component built manually to avoid hydration issues

---

## 🧠 Notes
- Missing keys throw dev-time warnings
- Designed to be scalable for 3+ languages in future
- Translation JSONs are manually maintained for control and simplicity
